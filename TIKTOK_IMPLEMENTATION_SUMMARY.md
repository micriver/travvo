## ðŸš€ Usage

### Search Results (Traditional List)

```typescript
import { FlightResultsList } from "@/components/search";

<FlightResultsList
  flights={searchResults.flights}
  onFlightBook={handleFlightBook}
  onFlightDetails={handleFlightDetails}
  onRefresh={performSearch}
  refreshing={loading}
/>;
```

### Discovery Feed (TikTok-Style)

```typescript
import { FlightCardCarousel } from "@/components/tiktok-flights";

<FlightCardCarousel
  flights={discoveryFlights}
  onFlightBook={handleFlightBook}
  onFlightDetails={handleFlightDetails}
  onIndexChange={handleIndexChange}
  initialIndex={0}
/>;
```

### Navigation Between Interfaces

- **Search**: Use from main search â†’ `/search-results` (traditional list)
- **Discovery**: Use compass button â†’ `/discovery` (TikTok feed)

### Media Service Usage

```typescript
import { mediaService } from "@/services/media/mediaService";

const media = await mediaService.getDestinationMedia("LAX", "Los Angeles");
```

## ðŸŽ¨ Design System Integration
